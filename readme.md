Libdarnit is a general purpose gamedev library initially intended for development of games for the OpenPandora handheld. Libdarnit is _not_ an engine, but a set of tools to build an engine with.

For information on how to build and install libdarnit, see the [wiki page](http://github.com/slaeshjag/libdarnit/wiki/Getting-started) about it.
